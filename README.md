# Pokémon Type Rankings
Ranks each Pokémon type mathematically. Still very WIP with more advanced features coming soon. Supports triple types (offesive, defensive, and total).

If you want to exclude triple types from the output change ``exclude_triple_types = False`` to ``exclude_triple_types = True`` but the visualiser will still show it.
